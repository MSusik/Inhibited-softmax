This repository contains source code that can reproduce results from the paper "Inhibited Softmax for Uncertainty Estimation in Neural Networks".

Please note:
* requirements.txt install CPU version of Pytorch that might be too slow for you
* In order to run experiments you have to download datasets and put them in correct directories
* Before running sentiment models, firstly you have to run preprocessing notebook

I provide a script download.sh that downloads all the required files.

The datasets that have to be downloaded:
* NOTMNIST - place in ./notMNIST_small - in case some of the images are corrupted, remove them
* Omniglot - ./omniglot
* LFW-a - ./lfw-a
* Reuters-21578 - ./nonmovies/reuters21578
* Customer Review data - ./nonmovies/customer\ review\ data
* Review Polarity - ./nonmovies/review_polarity
* Movie Reviews (IMDB) - ./movies/aclImdb
